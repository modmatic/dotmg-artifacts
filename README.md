Artifacts related to dotMG, such as shell files, circuit diagrams, etc.

## Shell files

Shell files include both 3D-printable STL files, and EPS files for laser cutting (recommended for looks).
STL files should be printed with a **0.2mm** layer height and **supports enabled**. They are pre-oriented for best results.

### Console

- The front/back faces can either be laser-cut or 3D-printed. Files for both options are included.
- The inner portions of the shell must be 3D-printed.

### Cart

- The front face can either be laser-cut or 3D-printed. Files for both options are included.
