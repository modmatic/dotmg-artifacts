Artifacts related to dotMG, such as shell files, circuit diagrams, etc.

## Shell files

Shell files include both 3D-printable STL files, and EPS files for laser cutting (recommended for looks).
STL files should be printed with a **0.2mm** layer height and **supports enabled**. They are pre-oriented for best results.

### Console

- The front/back faces can either be laser-cut or 3D-printed. Files for both options are included.

- The bezel around the screen can be laser-cut or 3D-printed, though 3D-printing is likely the best option for most because it should be thin.
If laser-cutting, multiple thin layers are recommended (solid color for bezel, fully transparent for protective covering). Lens layers are annotated in the EPS file.

- The inner portions of the shell must be 3D-printed.

- Required hardware: 4x nylon hex standoffs (M2.5, 8mm in length), 4x nylon countersink screws (start with 10-15mm and cut to length)

### Cart

- The front face can either be laser-cut or 3D-printed. Files for both options are included.

- The back portion of the shell must be 3D-printed.

- Required hardware: 2x nylon hex nuts (M2.5), 2x nylon countersink screws (start with 6mm and cut to length)
